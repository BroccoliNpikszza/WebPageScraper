## Web Page Scraper
COMP 3033 Final Project 

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BroccoliNpikszza/WebPageScraper.git
cd WebPageScraper/server
pip install beautifulsoup4
npm install
```

## Setting Up server

Weâ€™ll use node.js to run our server. Our app needs ability to fetch html and parse it. Relying on python libraries like beautiful soup will help us achieve our goal.

- setup a simple node.js server
- import child_process package
    
    ```jsx
    const {spawn} = require("child_process")
    ```
    
    child_process (spawn) documentation can be found [here.](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processspawncommand-args-options)
    
    TLDR:
    
    ```jsx
    // "spawn" spawns a new child process
    //syntax:
    const {spawn} = require("node:child_process");
    const process = spawn("command",["arg1","arg2"]);
    //by default runs on cwd
    //if path is given but does not exist, emits an ENOENT erros and exits
    ```
